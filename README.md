# Glyfi Bot

Discord bot for the Glyphs & Alphabets server.

The goal of this project is to encourage very collaborative development on this bot.

## Current functionality:

- `/select`: Provide the IDs of two messages in the channel between where to look for submissions.  
  Submissions will be collected and provided in one message, for extra easy downloading!
- `/set`: Set the emoji which to look for.
- `/get`: See the currently set emoji.

## Tech Stack

For the Programming Language, I chose [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp), because it is relatively accessible for any programmer.

For the Discord Library, I chose [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus), because it looked pretty good.
